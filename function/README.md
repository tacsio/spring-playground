# Spring Cloud Function

![logo][logo]

Spring Cloud Function is a project with the following high-level goals:
- Promote the implementation of business logic via functions.
- Decouple the development lifecycle of business logic from any specific runtime target so that the same code can run as a web endpoint, a stream processor, or a task.
- Support a uniform programming model across serverless providers, as well as the ability to run standalone (locally or in a PaaS).
- Enable Spring Boot features (auto-configuration, dependency injection, metrics) on serverless providers.

It abstracts away all of the transport details and infrastructure, allowing the developer to keep all the familiar tools and processes, and focus firmly on business logic.
